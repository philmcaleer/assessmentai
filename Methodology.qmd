## Designing Experiments and Methodologies

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Planning experimental or analytical procedures, including formulating hypotheses, choosing methods, selecting controls, determining sample sizes, and considering ethics. The gold standard is to design robust and ethical studies, guided by protocols, best practice guidelines, and supervisor input.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to rehearse methodological options, clarify unfamiliar steps, or suggest potential considerations (e.g., controls, sample size factors). Good practice means using GenAI as a prompt to check completeness, then confirming accuracy against disciplinary standards and ethical guidelines. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Outsourcing your design to GenAI without critical evaluation risks invalid, unethical, or unworkable methods. Poor practice undermines your ability to justify decisions and prevents you from developing expertise as a subject specialist.

## Collaborative Project Management

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Coordinating tasks within a group project, scheduling meetings, delegating responsibilities, and synthesising contributions. The gold standard is to communicate effectively and make joint decisions that reflect shared responsibility. Support is available through group discussions, project management tools, teamwork workshops, and supervisor mediation.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to generate task lists, draft timelines, or suggest meeting agendas, helping the group stay organised. Good practice means using these features to support coordination while all members actively contribute and make decisions collectively. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Relying on GenAI to manage projects or make decisions removes accountability and prevents development of essential teamwork skills. Poor practice includes outsourcing group contributions or disengaging from collaborative processes.

**Assessment Type:** Proposal, Dissertation, Group work,

**Example Assessments:** Group project, Group presentation, Poster group work

## Data Collection and Laboratory Techniques

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Carrying out experiments or fieldwork yourself to gather raw data. This includes following protocols, operating equipment, recording observations, and ensuring safety and ethical compliance. Because this develops practical and professional skills, the gold standard is to conduct all hands-on work yourself, keeping clear and accurate records, and reporting outcomes ethically. Support is available through lab manuals, safety training, and supervision.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to simulate what your dataset might look like for your planned method, or to rehearse methodology, helping you prepare for hands-on work and refine approaches. Practise troubleshooting by asking GenAI to explain protocols or predict common issues, but always consult trusted resources, be critical of AI outputs, and test or apply solutions yourself. Some unique GenAI features may be useful as assistive technology to record or reformat inputs, but check accuracy carefully and remain aware of data protection and sharing rules. Keep clear records of your activities and maintain hardcopy backups where appropriate. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** GenAI should not be used to fabricate data or lab results. Submitting simulated data as real, or using GenAI outputs without verification and acknowledgement, constitutes misconduct. Avoid replacing hands-on practice with GenAI simulations, as this hinders development of essential lab and fieldwork skills.

## Technology-assissted data collection and transformation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Using digital tools to automate or speed up data collection from an existing source (e.g. images, texts, signals, databases) or to convert and clean data into a usable format. The gold standard is to design clear extraction protocols, validate outputs at predefined checkpoints, and follow copyright, data-protection, and third-party software regulations. Teaching resources, methods guides, and peer support can help you apply appropriate quality assurance.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to design and rehearse data extraction workflows, generate example scripts, or clarify transformation steps before applying them to real data. Practise validating GenAI outputs against your protocols and document checkpoints for quality assurance. GenAI can also help compare approaches or highlight potential limitations, but you must remain in control of the process. Always follow copyright rules and protect sensitive or personal data when using GenAI tools. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Avoid over-relying on GenAI to extract or transform data without validation leads to inaccurate or fabricated outputs. Using GenAI to drive your process encourages questionable research practices such as HARKing, p-hacking, or unprincipled data dredging (cherry-picking). Uploading copyrighted, confidential, or personal material into GenAI tools without permission breaches regulations and ethics. Avoid skipping validity checks or presenting GenAI outputs as final results without independent review.
