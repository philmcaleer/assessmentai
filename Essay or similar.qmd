## Brainstorming and Broadening Understanding

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Exploratory stage where you gather general background information about a topic, read widely, refine your ideas and explore solutions or approaches to a task. This includes using textbooks, study materials, blogs, scholarly overviews, and conversations with peers or experts. The goal is to explore and learn rather than generate final arguments. Always distinguish this exploratory phase from a formal literature search. You are not expected to reference every source you explore at this stage, but you should acknowledge any people, tools, or services that made a significant contribution to shaping your thinking or work process.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Don't let consultation with GenAI become your default behaviour. Instead, first try making use of signposted support and actively engage with course resources and discussions with people. GenAI could help brainstorm ideas, summarise broad topics, or suggest concept maps, but always use alongside reliable resources and be mindful of the confirmation bias of GenAI, as it will tend to agree with your viewpoints and might not challenge you enough. Keep a record of how GenAI or any other resources shaped your ideas. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Defaulting to GenAI as your first and only source of input at this stage might reduce your ability to be resourceful, limit critical engagement with your subject, and take away the opportunity to develop interpersonal skills by discussing work-related topics, which could lead to lower performance in your profession in the long run. It is unethical to present ideas as entirely your own if it was wholly or partially produced by another person or tool - always reflect on your process and give credit to people, tools or services that significantly influenced your work process.

**Example Assessments:** Concept mapping exercises, Group ideation sessions with reflective write-up, Rapid-fire Q&A forums or idea dumps (formative)

## Developing Research Questions and Hypotheses

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Formulating clear research questions and hypotheses based on initial reading and understanding. The gold standard is to identify gaps in knowledge and propose testable ideas through critical analysis of literature. Support is available through research skills training, peer support, and supervisor feedback.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to brainstorm possible angles or phrasing, or to test how clearly a question is worded. You can also ask GenAI to generate potential variables or hypotheses for comparison, but you must critically refine, justify, and select your own. Good practice means using GenAI as a thinking partner to spark ideas while keeping ownership of your research focus. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Letting GenAI define your research question or hypothesis with minimal reflection undermines your understanding. Over-reliance risks shallow framing, misaligned questions, or gaps in logic, preventing you from developing expertise in your subject area.

**Example Assessments:** Submission of hypothesis with justification, Research question refinement workshop, Gap analysis task to develop question

## Drafting and Writing

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Produce the first full version of your assignment, or a large portion of it, by synthesising information from selected sources in your own words and constructing a logical argument or narrative. This includes structuring sections, writing introductions, and integrating evidence. Drafting is where you demonstrate understanding and decision-making, so it must be done by you, with encouragement to develop your own academic voice. Make use of peer support, teaching provisions, and writing guides.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** You must synthesise your work yourself to meet this learning objective. GenAI may be used as support tool to seek advice from, to develop structuring outlines (i.e. headings) or revise sentences after initial drafting. Always check the accuracy and relevance if you use GenAI suggestions. Keep a record of your interactions with GenAI to be transparent in your process and acknowledge the tool appropriately. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to generate content for any part of your draft — including collecting information and writing it up on your behalf — places you at risk for suspected misconduct. Over-reliance on GenAI risks not meeting assessment criteria, becoming less resourceful, not developing your own academic voice, and failing to build confidence in your ideas, methods, and words.

**Example Assessments:** Partial manuscript submissions (e.g., Introduction or Methods only), Writing workshops with iterative drafts, Peer-to-peer writing feedback with rubric

**Main Skills Category:** Writing

## Finalisation and Submission Preparation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Preparing the final version of your work for submission through effective time management, checking formatting, file naming conventions, word counts, and technical requirements (e.g. file type, size, formatting). This may involve converting documents to PDF, ensuring that all sections and appendices are included, and uploading files to the submission platform.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Engage directly with your material and apply study strategies relevant to your discipline, using GenAI only as a support tool while taking personal responsibility for the accuracy of the submission. GenAI can provide checklists and reminders to double-check formatting and technical requirements, but you must complete final checks yourself. It can also be used to help structure a step-by-step breakdown of your work process. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Over-relying on GenAI at this stage places you at risk of shortcutting your reasoning process, failing to notice errors that affect your submission, and neglecting the development of project management skills, such as checking requirements yourself and aligning your work correctly with the submission criteria.

**Example Assessments:** Pre-submission checklist with self-audit, Peer review and revision plan, Formatting and compliance review task

## Identifying Gaps and Critical Evaluation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Assessing the literature to identify missing information, conflicting evidence, or unanswered questions. The gold standard is to apply intellectual judgement, analyse strengths and limitations, and synthesise insights into a critical evaluation. Support includes tutorials on literature reviews, critical appraisal checklists, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to practise evaluation skills by asking it to highlight potential strengths and weaknesses in a study or suggest frameworks for critical appraisal. You can then compare these prompts against your own reading and apply validity checks. Good practice means attempting evaluation yourself first, then using GenAI to refine or deepen your approach. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Delegating the task of evaluation to GenAI undermines your ability to think critically. Accepting GenAI’s judgements without checking the original studies risks errors, bias, and academic misconduct. Over-reliance prevents you from building essential metacognitive skills in evaluation.

**Example Assessments:** Critical literature review, Gap identification and research need report, SWOT (Strenght, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) analysis of existing studies

**Main Skills Category:** Reasoning

## Literature Search and Source Evaluation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Carry out a structured search of relevant databases and other credible sources (e.g. academic databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, or trusted professional/organisational sites). Use clear keywords and filters to find reliable information, then evaluate sources for relevance, currency, and credibility.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** GenAI can support your process by suggesting search strategies (e.g. assisting with keywords, Boolean operators, or filters) or by explaining how to use different databases or tools. Some databases include GenAI-embedded functions, and specialist GenAI tools can also help. Take time to understand the strengths and limitations of the GenAI tool you use, for example if it only has access to metadata such as titles and abstracts. Good practice means using GenAI-powered tools as complements, not replacements, by running them in parallel with traditional searching and applying checkpoints at critical decision-making steps to ensure accuracy, coverage, and rigour. Follow copyright and third-party software rules: do not upload full journal articles or subscription-only content into GenAI tools. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Avoid using a general-purpose GenAI-tool like a database search - this may introduce bias, lead to false attribution or fabricated sources - instead see it as 'general reading and broadening understanding'. Avoid using GenAI to read and select papers on your behalf - this means you only engage with literature superficially and therefore have not found, evaluated and selected sources yourself. Could also increase time spent on literature searching, since all GenAI-suggested sources would need to be manually verified. Over-relying on GenAI risks that you develop a partial view of the topic and miss out on developing skills to be resourceful, objective and critical in your discipline.

**Example Assessments:** Annotated bibliography, Source comparison matrix, Search strategy justification report

**Main Skills Category:** Literature review

## Managing References and Citations

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Tracking bibliographic details for every source you consult and format citations correctly (e.g. APA, Harvard). Keep notes on which information comes from which source, use reference management tools such as EndNote, Mendeley or Zotero, and check formatting. Always ensure the corect source is credited for each idea in your work.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** GenAI may be used as a support tool to check formatting style, highlight possible errors, or flag places where citations are missing or unsupported. You must critically review its suggestions, confirm the accuracy of sources, and remain responsible for correct attribution. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to insert citations or build a reference list can lead to fabricated sources and mismatched attributions, creating inaccuracies that may amount to misconduct. Relying on GenAI too heavily can also mean you fail to learn the purpose of citations, or your field’s referencing style to substantiate arguments, leaving you unprepared for larger projects such as a dissertation.

**Example Assessments:** Reference list accuracy audit, Citation management software exercise, Peer-reviewed citation check activity

## Structuring, Editing and Proofreading

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Review and refine your own draft to improve clarity, coherence, grammar, tone and flow of arguments. Identify sections that need further development, reorganise or rewrite sections where needed, ensure each section has a purpose, and check citation accuracy. Strengthen your work with peer feedback, writing guides and other provided teaching support.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI as a support tool to provide feedback on your own draft, such as highlighting errors, outlining shortcomings and suggesting alternatives. Critically review suggestions and decide which changes to implement to help maintain your own voice, because the work is a reflection of you. Transparently acknowledge the use of GenAI for this purpose in your work and keep a record of your interactions with the tool. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Rewriting with GenAI can change original meaning and source attribution with in-text citations, leading to unintended inaccuracies. Submitting large sections of text rewritten by GenAI without proper review and/or without acknowledging GenAI transparently, places you at risk for suspected misconduct.  Over-reliance can lead to loss of your own voice, weaker development as a writer, and less effective communication over time.

**Example Assessments:** Rewriting poorly structured text, Structural editing task with rationale, Peer-editing assignment

## Abstract and Summary Writing

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Condensing a longer report, project, or dissertation into a concise summary highlighting objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. The gold standard is for students to synthesise their own key points, capture the significance of their work accurately, and present a balanced overview without omitting critical information. Support is available through writing workshops, study guides, and staff or peer feedback.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to review example abstracts or summary structures, or to suggest different ways of ordering key points, helping you check clarity and balance. You can also ask GenAI to highlight jargon or overly complex sentences so you can refine your own wording. Always ensure the abstract or summary is written by you, based on your actual work, and reflects your own interpretation of what is most important. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to draft an abstract or summary on your behalf, or copying generated text, risks inaccuracies and misconduct. Poor practice also includes failing to verify whether GenAI has omitted key points, introduced errors, or misrepresented your work. Over-reliance denies you the chance to develop the essential skill of condensing complex research into accurate, accessible summaries for academic and professional contexts.

**Example Assessments:** Structured abstract writing exercise, Lay summary and technical summary comparison, Abstract peer-assessment task, Poster, Conference submission

## Science Communication and Blogging

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Translating complex scientific concepts for a general audience, such as writing blog posts, news articles, or public-facing summaries. This requires clarity, accuracy, and engagement. The gold standard is to write content yourself, ensuring it is factually correct, well-structured, and accessible, while demonstrating subject expertise. Support is available through communication workshops, writing guides, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Keep ownership of the content and use GenAI to help you experiment with tone, structure, or alternative ways of framing your explanation for different audiences. You can also ask GenAI to show you examples of how scientific ideas are presented in public-facing contexts, then adapt these approaches in your own words. Always fact-check, cite genuine sources, and edit outputs so that your writing reflects your own understanding and voice. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to generate blog posts, articles, or summaries without fact-checking or editing risks plagiarism, inaccuracies, and misconduct. Over-reliance prevents you from developing subject expertise and from practising how to adapt your knowledge for different audiences. Ignoring accuracy or passing off GenAI-generated content as your own undermines both academic and professional credibility.

**Example Assessments:** Blog post for public audience, Infographic + explanatory caption, Social media thread or script writing task

**Main Skills Category:** Writing

## Scientific Graphic Design

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Designing clear, accurate, and visually compelling graphics to communicate scientific content such as cover art, illustrations, infographics, or custom visuals. The gold standard is for students to decide what needs to be represented, ensure accuracy of the scientific information, and check that all visuals comply with copyright and ethical standards. Support is available through graphic design workshops, software tutorials, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Keep ownership of the scientific message, using GenAI only to support the design process. You may ask GenAI to suggest layouts, colour schemes, icons, or alternative ways of representing concepts, but you must review and edit outputs to ensure scientific accuracy and originality. Good practice also means providing clear prompts, acknowledging GenAI appropriately, and checking compliance with copyright or licence terms. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Outsourcing design decisions to GenAI or accepting visuals without verification risks producing inaccurate or misleading graphics. Poor practice includes using unedited GenAI-generated diagrams, ignoring copyright or licence restrictions, or presenting content without checking its scientific validity. Over-reliance reduces your ability to practise presenting scientific concepts visually and weakens your confidence in producing original, accurate designs.

**Example Assessments:** Graphical abstract creation, Figure redesign task (from poor example), Poster design with peer critique
