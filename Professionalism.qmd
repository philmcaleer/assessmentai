## Ethical and Professional Responsibility

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Understanding and applying ethical principles, institutional policies, and national legal frameworks in academic and professional practice. This includes responsibilities such as completing risk assessments, protecting sensitive data, gaining informed consent, reporting misconduct or harassment, and upholding academic integrity. The gold standard is to know the relevant frameworks and act responsibly in real situations, ensuring compliance with institutional and legal requirements. Support is available through ethics training, codes of conduct, legal guidance, and supervision.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to help locate and summarise relevant institutional policies, codes of practice, or national legal requirements, but always cross-check with official sources. You can ask GenAI to clarify terminology, compare overlapping policies, or outline compliance steps, while you remain responsible for correct application. Good practice also means being proactive in seeking advice when unsure, keeping records of your decisions, and ensuring your conduct consistently aligns with institutional and legal standards. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Relying on GenAI to interpret or apply ethical rules without verifying against official documentation risks misconduct. Ignoring regulations, failing to complete required processes (e.g. risk assessments, consent forms), or treating GenAI’s outputs as authoritative undermines your accountability. Poor practice also includes neglecting to act when you witness unacceptable behaviour, copying policy text without understanding it, or failing to engage critically with institutional and legal expectations.

**Assessment Type:** Proposal, Dissertation, Group work,

## Coding and Software Trouble-shooting

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** When using tools like R, Python, SPSS, or Excel, students are expected to develop coding and software skills to analyse data and run workflows. The gold standard is to write, adapt, and test code independently, ensure accuracy, and understand how outputs fit into broader analysis. Support is available through coding tutorials, software documentation, and staff or peer feedback.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI as a computer language assistant without letting it replace your understanding. You can ask GenAI to troubleshoot coding errors, clarify syntax, or explain unfamiliar functions step by step. You may also use it to walk through logic flows, provide worked examples, or suggest debugging strategies — but you remain in charge of writing, adapting, and testing your code. Good practice means using GenAI as a tutor to support problem-solving and deepen your coding knowledge. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Relying on GenAI to generate whole scripts or run analyses on your behalf undermines your learning. Poor practice includes copying code without checking, skipping debugging, or failing to test and validate outputs. This prevents you from developing confidence in coding skills and can introduce errors into your analysis.

**Assessment Type:** Report with data analyses, Dissertation,

**Example Assessments:** Lab report, Quiz, PBL portfolio
