#  COMMUNICATION 
 
## Preparing and Practising Oral Presentations

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Developing the structure and content of an oral presentation, drafting speaker notes, preparing answers for anticipated questions, and rehearsing delivery. This includes creating an engaging narrative, practising timing, and building confidence in speaking skills. The focus is on oral communication rather than the design of accompanying material such as slides or a poster.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Make use of the unique features offered by GenAI to act as a rehearsal coach and strengthen your oral presentation. Use interactive or voice-to-text features to simulate verbal communication, run Q&A drills for different audiences, generate clear explanations or analogies, test your message in shorter or longer formats, and check clarity or pacing from a draft transcript. These tools can support your preparation, but the delivery and final presentation must be practised and performed by you. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Avoid relying on GenAI instead of taking real practice opportunities provided through teaching and peer support. This limits your ability to rehearse responses to genuine audience questions and weakens the communication skills needed for academic and professional growth. Using GenAI to draft or memorise large parts of a script prevents you from developing subject expertise, learning how to communicate your discipline effectively, reframing knowledge for different audiences, and building confidence in explaining ideas in your own words.

## Multimedia Production

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Creating dynamic media assets such as videos, animations, podcasts, or screencasts to communicate scientific concepts, demonstrate practical procedures, or engage audiences. The gold standard is for students to make content decisions themselves and ensure outputs are accurate, original, and compliant with copyright, data protection, and third-party software regulations. Production and editing may involve various tools, provided students remain responsible for accuracy, originality, and regulatory compliance.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Keep ownership of the content, using GenAI only to refine or extend your ideas and support the production process. Set clear direction, give specific prompts, critically review outputs, and make final edits so that the final product reflects your own voice. GenAI can suggest visual cues, editing tips, or draft script outlines, and help check clarity and accessibility â€” but you must ensure all outputs comply with regulatory requirements. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Relying on GenAI to decide content or failing to critically review outputs undermines your responsibility for originality and compliance. Poor practice includes ignoring copyright or data protection rules, submitting unedited GenAI outputs as your own without acknowledgement, or failing to safeguard against fabricated or plagiarised content. Over-reliance outsources your decision-making and denies you the chance to practise communicating in your own style.

## Scientific Graphic Design

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Designing clear, accurate, and visually compelling graphics to communicate scientific content such as cover art, illustrations, infographics, or custom visuals. The gold standard is for students to decide what needs to be represented, ensure accuracy of the scientific information, and check that all visuals comply with copyright and ethical standards. Support is available through graphic design workshops, software tutorials, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Keep ownership of the scientific message, using GenAI only to support the design process. You may ask GenAI to suggest layouts, colour schemes, icons, or alternative ways of representing concepts, but you must review and edit outputs to ensure scientific accuracy and originality. Good practice also means providing clear prompts, acknowledging GenAI appropriately, and checking compliance with copyright or licence terms. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Outsourcing design decisions to GenAI or accepting visuals without verification risks producing inaccurate or misleading graphics. Poor practice includes using unedited GenAI-generated diagrams, ignoring copyright or licence restrictions, or presenting content without checking its scientific validity. Over-reliance reduces your ability to practise presenting scientific concepts visually and weakens your confidence in producing original, accurate designs.

**Assessment Type:** Essay or similar, Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,

## Visual Aids for Presentation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Preparing slideshows or other visual elements (e.g. posters, pamphlets, title slides, information sheets, or visual cues) to support a spoken or performed presentation. The gold standard is to create accurate, accessible, and well-designed visual aids that complement, rather than replace, your oral delivery. Support is available through presentation workshops, software training, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Keep ownership of the content and use GenAI to support the design process. You can ask GenAI for step-by-step instructions for using tools, enabling you to build your digital skills. You can also use GenAI to suggest a logical flow, outline, or draft slides from material you provide, or to give feedback on clarity, accessibility, and audience engagement. Good practice means ensuring that slides accurately reflect your spoken content and making final edits so visuals support rather than dominate your delivery. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to create presentation content on your behalf places you at risk of suspected misconduct by outsourcing ownership of your ideas. Failing to effectively instruct or critically check GenAI outputs may introduce errors or misleading visuals. Over-reliance on GenAI to design presentations limits your opportunity to practise structuring visual aids for presntations and developing important digital skills for academic and professional growth.
