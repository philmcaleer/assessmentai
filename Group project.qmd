## Collaborative Project Management

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Coordinating tasks within a group project, scheduling meetings, delegating responsibilities, and synthesising contributions. The gold standard is to communicate effectively and make joint decisions that reflect shared responsibility. Support is available through group discussions, project management tools, teamwork workshops, and supervisor mediation.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to generate task lists, draft timelines, or suggest meeting agendas, helping the group stay organised. Good practice means using these features to support coordination while all members actively contribute and make decisions collectively. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Relying on GenAI to manage projects or make decisions removes accountability and prevents development of essential teamwork skills. Poor practice includes outsourcing group contributions or disengaging from collaborative processes.
