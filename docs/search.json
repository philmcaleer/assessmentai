    "text": "Gold standard for Professional Practice: In structured PBL scenarios, students explore open-ended scientific questions or case studies. The gold standard is to use this process to deepen reasoning, integrate knowledge, and develop collaborative problem-solving skills. It is not about finding a single correct answer but about building your capacity to investigate and justify different approaches. Support is available through group discussions, facilitator guidance, and case study resources.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to enhance reflection and broaden perspectives, for example by generating possible frameworks, surfacing overlooked angles, or posing counterarguments to test your reasoning. Good practice means first engaging actively with peers and course resources, then using GenAI to refine or stress-test your ideas while ensuring your analysis remains your own.\nHow GenAI can psoe risks (poor practice): Allowing GenAI to propose full solutions or carry out the analysis for you undermines the purpose of PBL and constitutes misconduct. Over-relying on GenAI discourages critical engagement with peers and tutors, limits your ability to practise reasoning skills, and risks presenting GenAI’s suggestions as your own work without evaluation.\nMain Skills Category: Critical thinking\nAssessment Type: Reflection, PBL and Problem-solving.\nExample Assessments: PBL portfolio, Reflective write-ups, Case-based activities",

    "text": "Gold standard for Professional Practice: In defined exercises (e.g. calculating rates, deriving a formula, optimising a protocol), the focus is on applying knowledge and demonstrating mastery of methods. The gold standard is to show your reasoning clearly, follow the solution path independently, and verify your answer. Support is available through worked examples, tutorials, and feedback from staff or peers.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI for hints, worked examples, or to identify logical errors in your reasoning, but ensure you complete all problem-solving steps yourself. You might ask GenAI to explain why a method works or to suggest alternative approaches, then apply and check these independently. Good practice means using GenAI as a tutor to clarify concepts while taking responsibility for the solution.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to provide answers or complete calculations on your behalf prevents you from developing the problem-solving skills being assessed, and therefore constitutes misconduct. Poor practice includes copying solutions without understanding, skipping the reasoning steps, or failing to check accuracy. Over-reliance undermines your ability to justify and apply solutions in future contexts.\nMain Skills Category: Critical thinking\nAssessment Type: Invigilated exam or test, PBL and Problem-solving,\nExample Assessments: Set exercises, Class problems, MCQs with rationale",
