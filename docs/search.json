    "text": "Preparing and Practising Oral Presentations\nGold standard for Professional Practice: Developing the structure and content of an oral presentation, drafting speaker notes, preparing answers for anticipated questions, and rehearsing delivery. This includes creating an engaging narrative, practising timing, and building confidence in speaking skills. The focus is on oral communication rather than the design of accompanying material such as slides or a poster.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Make use of the unique features offered by GenAI to act as a rehearsal coach and strengthen your oral presentation. Use interactive or voice-to-text features to simulate verbal communication, run Q&A drills for different audiences, generate clear explanations or analogies, test your message in shorter or longer formats, and check clarity or pacing from a draft transcript. These tools can support your preparation, but the delivery and final presentation must be practised and performed by you.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Avoid relying on GenAI instead of taking real practice opportunities provided through teaching and peer support. This limits your ability to rehearse responses to genuine audience questions and weakens the communication skills needed for academic and professional growth. Using GenAI to draft or memorise large parts of a script prevents you from developing subject expertise, learning how to communicate your discipline effectively, reframing knowledge for different audiences, and building confidence in explaining ideas in your own words.\nAssessment Type: Presentation,\nExample Assessments: Recorded practice presentation with feedback, Pitch-style presentation, Peer-assessed presentation rehearsal",

The gold standard is for students to make content decisions themselves and ensure outputs are accurate, original, and compliant with copyright, data protection, and third-party software regulations. Production and editing may involve various tools, provided students remain responsible for accuracy, originality, and regulatory compliance.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Keep ownership of the content, using GenAI only to refine or extend your ideas and support the production process. Set clear direction, give specific prompts, critically review outputs, and make final edits so that the final product reflects your own voice. GenAI can suggest visual cues, editing tips, or draft script outlines, and help check clarity and accessibility — but you must ensure all outputs comply with regulatory requirements.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Relying on GenAI to decide content or failing to critically review outputs undermines your responsibility for originality and compliance. Poor practice includes ignoring copyright or data protection rules, submitting unedited GenAI outputs as your own without acknowledgement, or failing to safeguard against fabricated or plagiarised content. Over-reliance outsources your decision-making and denies you the chance to practise communicating in your own style.\nAssessment Type: Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,\nExample Assessments: Educational video on a scientific concept, Interactive visual explainer, Audio/podcast summary of topic",

The gold standard is for students to decide what needs to be represented, ensure accuracy of the scientific information, and check that all visuals comply with copyright and ethical standards. Support is available through graphic design workshops, software tutorials, and feedback from staff or peers.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Keep ownership of the scientific message, using GenAI only to support the design process. You may ask GenAI to suggest layouts, colour schemes, icons, or alternative ways of representing concepts, but you must review and edit outputs to ensure scientific accuracy and originality. Good practice also means providing clear prompts, acknowledging GenAI appropriately, and checking compliance with copyright or licence terms.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Outsourcing design decisions to GenAI or accepting visuals without verification risks producing inaccurate or misleading graphics. Poor practice includes using unedited GenAI-generated diagrams, ignoring copyright or licence restrictions, or presenting content without checking its scientific validity. Over-reliance reduces your ability to practise presenting scientific concepts visually and weakens your confidence in producing original, accurate designs.\nAssessment Type: Essay or similar, Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,\nExample Assessments: Graphical abstract creation, Figure redesign task (from poor example), Poster design with peer critique",

The gold standard is to create accurate, accessible, and well-designed visual aids that complement, rather than replace, your oral delivery. Support is available through presentation workshops, software training, and feedback from staff or peers.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Keep ownership of the content and use GenAI to support the design process. You can ask GenAI for step-by-step instructions for using tools, enabling you to build your digital skills. You can also use GenAI to suggest a logical flow, outline, or draft slides from material you provide, or to give feedback on clarity, accessibility, and audience engagement. Good practice means ensuring that slides accurately reflect your spoken content and making final edits so visuals support rather than dominate your delivery.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to create presentation content on your behalf places you at risk of suspected misconduct by outsourcing ownership of your ideas. Failing to effectively instruct or critically check GenAI outputs may introduce errors or misleading visuals.

The gold standard is for students to select the correct type of visual, apply appropriate statistical reasoning, and interpret outputs accurately in context. Support is available through statistics workshops, software tutorials, and guidance from staff or peers.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to learn how to use visualisation tools — for example, by asking for code explanations, step-by-step instructions, or troubleshooting errors in R or Python. You can also use GenAI to get feedback on whether your visual communicates results clearly, or for tips on improving accessibility and design. Good practice means always producing the visualisation yourself in specialist software, checking accuracy, and keeping data secure. Never upload unpublished or sensitive data into GenAI tools.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to generate visuals directly, instead of producing them yourself in purpose-built data visualisation software, prevents you from developing essential research skills. Failing to safeguard sensitive or unpublished data risks breaching confidentiality and data protection rules. Relying on GenAI to decide which visual to use, or failing to verify its outputs, may lead to misleading or inaccurate representations of your data.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,\nExample Assessments: Data-to-visual transformation assignment, Critique of published visualisations, Visual storytelling task with dataset",

The gold standard is for students to justify their choice of test, apply it correctly, and interpret outcomes appropriately in relation to the research question. Support is available through statistics workshops, study guides, and staff or peer feedback.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): You should never provide your data to a GenAI tool to perform statistical analyses. Use GenAI to clarify statistical concepts, explore test assumptions, or work through example problems step by step. You can also ask GenAI to explain what different test outputs mean or to review your reasoning process. Good practice means applying this knowledge yourself to select, run, and interpret tests in specialist software, ensuring outputs are accurate, transparent, and relevant to your research question.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to choose tests or run analyses on your behalf without understanding why they are used creates risks of misinterpretation and potential misconduct. Poor practice includes copying GenAI outputs directly into your work, misreporting results, or failing to check assumptions. Relying on GenAI in place of developing your own statistical reasoning prevents you from building essential expertise for research and professional practice.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Practical skills, Dissertation,\nExample Assessments: Analysis plan and rationale submission, Raw data to analysis report, Interpretation of outputs from statistical software",

The gold standard is to write, adapt, and test code independently, ensure accuracy, and understand how outputs fit into broader analysis. Support is available through coding tutorials, software documentation, and staff or peer feedback.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI as a computer language assistant without letting it replace your understanding. You can ask GenAI to troubleshoot coding errors, clarify syntax, or explain unfamiliar functions step by step. You may also use it to walk through logic flows, provide worked examples, or suggest debugging strategies — but you remain in charge of writing, adapting, testing and annotating your code for reproducibility. Good practice means using GenAI as a tutor to support problem-solving and deepen your coding knowledge and citing the tools that you use in your scripts.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Relying on GenAI to generate whole scripts or run analyses on your behalf undermines your learning. Poor practice includes copying code without checking, skipping debugging, or failing to test and validate outputs. This prevents you from developing confidence in coding skills and can introduce errors into your analysis. If you do not acknowledge the sources, that is also a form of plagiarism.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Dissertation,\nExample Assessments: Code debugging activity, Script annotation and explanation task, Peer-troubleshooting logs",

Use clear keywords and filters to find reliable information, then evaluate sources for relevance, currency, and credibility.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): GenAI can support your process by suggesting search strategies (e.g. assisting with keywords, Boolean operators, or filters) or by explaining how to use different databases or tools. Some databases include GenAI-embedded functions, and specialist GenAI tools can also help. Take time to understand the strengths and limitations of the GenAI tool you use, for example if it only has access to metadata such as titles and abstracts. Good practice means using GenAI-powered tools as complements, not replacements, by running them in parallel with traditional searching and applying checkpoints at critical decision-making steps to ensure accuracy, coverage, and rigour. Follow copyright and third-party software rules: do not upload full journal articles or subscription-only content into GenAI tools.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Avoid using a general-purpose GenAI-tool like a database search - this may introduce bias, lead to false attribution or fabricated sources - instead see it as ‘general reading and broadening understanding’. Avoid using GenAI to read and select papers on your behalf - this means you only engage with literature superficially and therefore have not found, evaluated and selected sources yourself. Could also increase time spent on literature searching, since all GenAI-suggested sources would need to be manually verified. Over-relying on GenAI risks that you develop a partial view of the topic and miss out on developing skills to be resourceful, objective and critical in your discipline.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Essay or similar, Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,\nExample Assessments: Annotated bibliography, Source comparison matrix, Search strategy justification report",

Because this develops practical and professional skills, the gold standard is to conduct all hands-on work yourself, keeping clear and accurate records, and reporting outcomes ethically. Support is available through lab manuals, safety training, and supervision.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to simulate what your dataset might look like for your planned method, or to rehearse methodology, helping you prepare for hands-on work and refine approaches. Practise troubleshooting by asking GenAI to explain protocols or predict common issues, but always consult trusted resources, be critical of AI outputs, and test or apply solutions yourself. Some unique GenAI features may be useful as assistive technology to record or reformat inputs, but check accuracy carefully and remain aware of data protection and sharing rules. Keep clear records of your activities and maintain hardcopy backups where appropriate.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): GenAI should not be used to fabricate data or lab results.

The gold standard is to design clear extraction protocols, validate outputs at predefined checkpoints, and follow copyright, data-protection, and third-party software regulations. Teaching resources, methods guides, and peer support can help you apply appropriate quality assurance.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to design and rehearse data extraction workflows, generate example scripts, or clarify transformation steps before applying them to real data. Practise validating GenAI outputs against your protocols and document checkpoints for quality assurance. GenAI can also help compare approaches or highlight potential limitations, but you must remain in control of the process.

Always distinguish this exploratory phase from a formal literature search. You are not expected to reference every source you explore at this stage, but you should acknowledge any people, tools, or services that made a significant contribution to shaping your thinking or work process.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Don’t let consultation with GenAI become your default behaviour. Instead, first try making use of signposted support and actively engage with course resources and discussions with people. GenAI could help brainstorm ideas, summarise broad topics, or suggest concept maps, but always use alongside reliable resources and be mindful of the confirmation bias of GenAI, as it will tend to agree with your viewpoints and might not challenge you enough.

The gold standard is to actively design and attempt these yourself to reveal gaps in understanding, strengthen recall, and practise applying knowledge. Support is available through revision resources, peer study groups, and staff feedback.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to generate practice questions, flashcards, or typical problems after you have first attempted to think of some yourself. Compare GenAI’s suggestions with your own to identify overlooked areas or alternative question styles. You can also use GenAI to test your recall by generating variations on your questions, but you must write and check the answers yourself. Good practice means using GenAI as a supplement to broaden revision, not as a substitute for self-testing.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to produce and answer all your practice questions for you prevents you from learning effectively and risks building poor habits, such as defaulting to GenAI even for simple tasks you could do yourself.

The gold standard is to apply intellectual judgement, analyse strengths and limitations, and synthesise insights into a critical evaluation. Support includes tutorials on literature reviews, critical appraisal checklists, and feedback from staff or peers.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to practise evaluation skills by asking it to highlight potential strengths and weaknesses in a study or suggest frameworks for critical appraisal. You can then compare these prompts against your own reading and apply validity checks. Good practice means attempting evaluation yourself first, then using GenAI to refine or deepen your approach.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Delegating the task of evaluation to GenAI undermines your ability to think critically.

The gold standard is to interpret results in your own words, showing critical insight and linking to relevant research. Support is available through lectures, tutorials, writing guides, and feedback from staff or peers.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): First interpret your results yourself, then use available resources to improve clarity and depth, which may include GenAI. Use GenAI to practise communicating your findings by generating alternative phrasings, asking it to highlight unclear sections, or drafting practice questions that test your reasoning. You can also use GenAI to simulate counterarguments or alternative explanations, which you must then address in your own words. These uses can help refine your ability to express your interpretation clearly and critically.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Allowing GenAI to interpret your results or generate conclusions on your behalf undermines your understanding and constitutes poor practice.

This requires honest introspection, critical self-analysis, and connecting your experiences to relevant theory. The content must come from your own thinking and perspective, not from literature summaries or external sources. In your work, you should demonstrate how you interpret, evaluate, and learn from your experiences, and how this shapes your development, rather than simply listing what you did, when, where, and how.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Reflections should always be written by you. Start by making use of signposted support and reflective frameworks to develop meaningful self-analysis strategies and draft your initial ideas, before turning to GenAI. You can then use GenAI as a supporting tool to help structure your ideas or proofread your work. It may also be used to clarify your understanding in a structured way, for example by asking a set of questions, but the personal meaning and connections must come from you. Good practice means engaging directly with your experiences and applying reflective strategies relevant to your discipline.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to generate or rewrite a reflection on your behalf places you at risk of suspected misconduct, even if you acknowledge its use.

Use clear keywords and filters to find reliable information, then evaluate sources for relevance, currency, and credibility.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): GenAI can support your process by suggesting search strategies (e.g. assisting with keywords, Boolean operators, or filters) or by explaining how to use different databases or tools. Some databases include GenAI-embedded functions, and specialist GenAI tools can also help. Take time to understand the strengths and limitations of the GenAI tool you use, for example if it only has access to metadata such as titles and abstracts. Good practice means using GenAI-powered tools as complements, not replacements, by running them in parallel with traditional searching and applying checkpoints at critical decision-making steps to ensure accuracy, coverage, and rigour. Follow copyright and third-party software rules: do not upload full journal articles or subscription-only content into GenAI tools.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Avoid using a general-purpose GenAI-tool like a database search - this may introduce bias, lead to false attribution or fabricated sources - instead see it as ‘general reading and broadening understanding’. Avoid using GenAI to read and select papers on your behalf - this means you only engage with literature superficially and therefore have not found, evaluated and selected sources yourself. Over-relying on GenAI risks that you develop a partial view of the topic and miss out on developing skills to be resourceful, objective and critical in your discipline.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Essay or similar, Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,\nMain Skills Category: Literature review",

    "text": "Managing References and Citations\nGold standard for Professional Practice: Tracking bibliographic details for every source you consult and format citations correctly (e.g. APA, Harvard). Keep notes on which information comes from which source, use reference management tools such as EndNote, Mendeley or Zotero, and checking formatting. Always ensure the corect source is credited for each idea in your work.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): GenAI may be used as a support tool to check formatting style, highlight possible errors, or flag places where citations are missing or unsupported. You must critically review its suggestions, confirm the accuracy of sources, and remain responsible for correct attribution.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Using GenAI to insert citations or build a reference list can lead to fabricated sources and mismatched attributions, creating inaccuracies that may amount to misconduct. Relying on GenAI too heavily can also mean you fail to learn the purpose of citations, or your field’s referencing style to substantiate arguments, leaving you unprepared for larger projects such as a dissertation.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Essay or similar, Presentation, Proposal, Dissertation,\nMain Skills Category: Literature review",

Good practice means using these features to support coordination while all members actively contribute and make decisions collectively.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): Relying on GenAI to manage projects or make decisions removes accountability and prevents development of essential teamwork skills.

This includes following protocols, operating equipment, recording observations, and ensuring safety and ethical compliance. Because this develops practical and professional skills, the gold standard is to conduct all hands-on work yourself, keeping clear and accurate records, and reporting outcomes ethically. Support is available through lab manuals, safety training, and supervision.\nHow GenAI can be helpful (good practice): Use GenAI to simulate what your dataset might look like for your planned method, or to rehearse methodology, helping you prepare for hands-on work and refine approaches. Practise troubleshooting by asking GenAI to explain protocols or predict common issues, but always consult trusted resources, be critical of AI outputs, and test or apply solutions yourself. Some unique GenAI features may be useful as assistive technology to record or reformat inputs, but check accuracy carefully and remain aware of data protection and sharing rules. Keep clear records of your activities and maintain hardcopy backups where appropriate.\nHow GenAI can pose risks (poor practice): GenAI should not be used to fabricate data or lab results. Submitting simulated data as real, or using GenAI outputs without verification and acknowledgement, constitutes misconduct. Avoid replacing hands-on practice with GenAI simulations, as this hinders development of essential lab and fieldwork skills.\nAssessment Type: Report with data analyses, Practical skills, Dissertation,\nMain Skills Category: Methodology",
