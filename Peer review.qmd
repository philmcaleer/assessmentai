## Brainstorming and Broadening Understanding

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Exploratory stage where you gather general background information about a topic, read widely, refine your ideas and explore solutions or approaches to a task. This includes using textbooks, study materials, blogs, scholarly overviews, and conversations with peers or experts. The goal is to explore and learn rather than generate final arguments. Always distinguish this exploratory phase from a formal literature search. You are not expected to reference every source you explore at this stage, but you should acknowledge any people, tools, or services that made a significant contribution to shaping your thinking or work process.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Don't let consultation with GenAI become your default behaviour. Instead, first try making use of signposted support and actively engage with course resources and discussions with people. GenAI could help brainstorm ideas, summarise broad topics, or suggest concept maps, but always use alongside reliable resources and be mindful of the confirmation bias of GenAI, as it will tend to agree with your viewpoints and might not challenge you enough. Keep a record of how GenAI or any other resources shaped your ideas. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Defaulting to GenAI as your first and only source of input at this stage might reduce your ability to be resourceful, limit critical engagement with your subject, and take away the opportunity to develop interpersonal skills by discussing work-related topics, which could lead to lower performance in your profession in the long run. It is unethical to present ideas as entirely your own if it was wholly or partially produced by another person or tool - always reflect on your process and give credit to people, tools or services that significantly influenced your work process.

**Example Assessments:** Concept mapping exercises, Group ideation sessions with reflective write-up, Rapid-fire Q&A forums or idea dumps (formative)

## Drafting and Writing

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Produce the first full version of your assignment, or a large portion of it, by synthesising information from selected sources in your own words and constructing a logical argument or narrative. This includes structuring sections, writing introductions, and integrating evidence. Drafting is where you demonstrate understanding and decision-making, so it must be done by you, with encouragement to develop your own academic voice. Make use of peer support, teaching provisions, and writing guides.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** You must synthesise your work yourself to meet this learning objective. GenAI may be used as support tool to seek advice from, to develop structuring outlines (i.e. headings) or revise sentences after initial drafting. Always check the accuracy and relevance if you use GenAI suggestions. Keep a record of your interactions with GenAI to be transparent in your process and acknowledge the tool appropriately. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to generate content for any part of your draft — including collecting information and writing it up on your behalf — places you at risk for suspected misconduct. Over-reliance on GenAI risks not meeting assessment criteria, becoming less resourceful, not developing your own academic voice, and failing to build confidence in your ideas, methods, and words.

**Example Assessments:** Partial manuscript submissions (e.g., Introduction or Methods only), Writing workshops with iterative drafts, Peer-to-peer writing feedback with rubric

## Finalisation and Submission Preparation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Preparing the final version of your work for submission through effective time management, checking formatting, file naming conventions, word counts, and technical requirements (e.g. file type, size, formatting). This may involve converting documents to PDF, ensuring that all sections and appendices are included, and uploading files to the submission platform.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Engage directly with your material and apply study strategies relevant to your discipline, using GenAI only as a support tool while taking personal responsibility for the accuracy of the submission. GenAI can provide checklists and reminders to double-check formatting and technical requirements, but you must complete final checks yourself. It can also be used to help structure a step-by-step breakdown of your work process. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Over-relying on GenAI at this stage places you at risk of shortcutting your reasoning process, failing to notice errors that affect your submission, and neglecting the development of project management skills, such as checking requirements yourself and aligning your work correctly with the submission criteria.

**Example Assessments:** Pre-submission checklist with self-audit, Peer review and revision plan, Formatting and compliance review task

## Identifying Gaps and Critical Evaluation

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Assessing the literature to identify missing information, conflicting evidence, or unanswered questions. The gold standard is to apply intellectual judgement, analyse strengths and limitations, and synthesise insights into a critical evaluation. Support includes tutorials on literature reviews, critical appraisal checklists, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to practise evaluation skills by asking it to highlight potential strengths and weaknesses in a study or suggest frameworks for critical appraisal. You can then compare these prompts against your own reading and apply validity checks. Good practice means attempting evaluation yourself first, then using GenAI to refine or deepen your approach. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Delegating the task of evaluation to GenAI undermines your ability to think critically. Accepting GenAI’s judgements without checking the original studies risks errors, bias, and academic misconduct. Over-reliance prevents you from building essential metacognitive skills in evaluation.

**Example Assessments:** Critical literature review, Gap identification and research need report, SWOT (Strenght, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) analysis of existing studies

## Reflective and Personal Writing

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Writing reflective essays or journals that describe your own personal experiences, development, and learning. This requires honest introspection, critical self-analysis, and connecting your experiences to relevant theory. The content must come from your own thinking and perspective, not from literature summaries or external sources. In your work, you should demonstrate how you interpret, evaluate, and learn from your experiences, and how this shapes your development, rather than simply listing what you did, when, where, and how.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Reflections should always be written by you. Start by making use of signposted support and reflective frameworks to develop meaningful self-analysis strategies and draft your initial ideas, before turning to GenAI. You can then use GenAI as a supporting tool to help structure your ideas or proofread your work. It may also be used to clarify your understanding in a structured way, for example by asking a set of questions, but the personal meaning and connections must come from you. Good practice means engaging directly with your experiences and applying reflective strategies relevant to your discipline. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to generate or rewrite a reflection on your behalf places you at risk of suspected misconduct, even if you acknowledge its use. It also prevents you from showing genuine personal insight or meeting assessment criteria, and causes you to miss the chance to practise self-analysis, link experiences to theory in your own words, and develop reflective skills essential for academic and professional growth.

**Example Assessments:** Reflective journal entries, Professional development narrative, Critical incident reflection

## Structuring, Editing and Proofreading

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Review and refine your own draft to improve clarity, coherence, grammar, tone and flow of arguments. Identify sections that need further development, reorganise or rewrite sections where needed, ensure each section has a purpose, and check citation accuracy. Strengthen your work with peer feedback, writing guides and other provided teaching support.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI as a support tool to provide feedback on your own draft, such as highlighting errors, outlining shortcomings and suggesting alternatives. Critically review suggestions and decide which changes to implement to help maintain your own voice, because the work is a reflection of you. Transparently acknowledge the use of GenAI for this purpose in your work and keep a record of your interactions with the tool. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Rewriting with GenAI can change original meaning and source attribution with in-text citations, leading to unintended inaccuracies. Submitting large sections of text rewritten by GenAI without proper review and/or without acknowledging GenAI transparently, places you at risk for suspected misconduct.  Over-reliance can lead to loss of your own voice, weaker development as a writer, and less effective communication over time.

**Example Assessments:** Rewriting poorly structured text, Structural editing task with rationale, Peer-editing assignment

## Peer Review and Journal Club

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Critically reviewing research papers or peers’ work, summarising findings, evaluating strengths and weaknesses, and discussing implications. The gold standard is to read and interpret the original texts, verify accuracy, and engage in constructive critique. Support is available through journal clubs, peer discussions, and feedback from staff.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to generate practice summaries, propose counterarguments, or highlight points you may have missed, then check these against the original source. Good practice means using GenAI as a rehearsal tool for critical discussion while ensuring your critique reflects your own reading and judgement. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Submitting GenAI summaries as your own or failing to engage with the original work risks misrepresentation, plagiarism, and failure to develop critical thinking. Uploading peers’ unpublished work into GenAI tools also breaches copyright and confidentiality.

**Example Assessments:** Written peer review of a preprint article, Journal club presentation with critique, Structured review using journal guidelines
