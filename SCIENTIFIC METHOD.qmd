## Research Proposal and Grant Writing

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Writing a structured document that outlines a proposed study or project, including objectives, background, methodology, budget, and timeline. The gold standard is to present a persuasive and feasible proposal based on your own expertise and understanding. Support is available through grant-writing workshops, exemplars, and supervisor guidance.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to brainstorm outlines, generate alternative structures, or test phrasing for clarity and persuasiveness. You can also ask GenAI to check readability or highlight jargon, but final decisions must reflect your own knowledge and project specifics. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Letting GenAI draft large parts of your proposal risks generic, inaccurate, or non-viable content. Over-reliance prevents you from developing and demonstrating your expertise and weakens your ability to independently manage complex projects.

**Assessment Type:** Proposal,

**Example Assessments:** Research Proposal, Project report, Grant proposal
