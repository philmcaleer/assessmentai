## Peer Review and Journal Club

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Critically reviewing research papers or peers’ work, summarising findings, evaluating strengths and weaknesses, and discussing implications. The gold standard is to read and interpret the original texts, verify accuracy, and engage in constructive critique. Support is available through journal clubs, peer discussions, and feedback from staff.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to generate practice summaries, propose counterarguments, or highlight points you may have missed, then check these against the original source. Good practice means using GenAI as a rehearsal tool for critical discussion while ensuring your critique reflects your own reading and judgement. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Submitting GenAI summaries as your own or failing to engage with the original work risks misrepresentation, plagiarism, and failure to develop critical thinking. Uploading peers’ unpublished work into GenAI tools also breaches copyright and confidentiality.

**Assessment Type:** Peer review,

**Main Skills Category:** Critical thinking
