## Drafting and Writing

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Produce the first full version of your assignment, or a large portion of it, by synthesising information from selected sources in your own words and constructing a logical argument or narrative. This includes structuring sections, writing introductions, and integrating evidence. Drafting is where you demonstrate understanding and decision-making, so it must be done by you, with encouragement to develop your own academic voice. Make use of peer support, teaching provisions, and writing guides.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** You must synthesise your work yourself to meet this learning objective. GenAI may be used as support tool to seek advice from, to develop structuring outlines (i.e. headings) or revise sentences after initial drafting. Always check the accuracy and relevance if you use GenAI suggestions. Keep a record of your interactions with GenAI to be transparent in your process and acknowledge the tool appropriately. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to generate content for any part of your draft — including collecting information and writing it up on your behalf — places you at risk for suspected misconduct. Over-reliance on GenAI risks not meeting assessment criteria, becoming less resourceful, not developing your own academic voice, and failing to build confidence in your ideas, methods, and words.

**Example Assessments:** Partial manuscript submissions (e.g., Introduction or Methods only), Writing workshops with iterative drafts, Peer-to-peer writing feedback with rubric

## Structuring, Editing and Proofreading

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Review and refine your own draft to improve clarity, coherence, grammar, tone and flow of arguments. Identify sections that need further development, reorganise or rewrite sections where needed, ensure each section has a purpose, and check citation accuracy. Strengthen your work with peer feedback, writing guides and other provided teaching support.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI as a support tool to provide feedback on your own draft, such as highlighting errors, outlining shortcomings and suggesting alternatives. Critically review suggestions and decide which changes to implement to help maintain your own voice, because the work is a reflection of you. Transparently acknowledge the use of GenAI for this purpose in your work and keep a record of your interactions with the tool. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Rewriting with GenAI can change original meaning and source attribution with in-text citations, leading to unintended inaccuracies. Submitting large sections of text rewritten by GenAI without proper review and/or without acknowledging GenAI transparently, places you at risk for suspected misconduct.  Over-reliance can lead to loss of your own voice, weaker development as a writer, and less effective communication over time.

**Example Assessments:** Rewriting poorly structured text, Structural editing task with rationale, Peer-editing assignment

## Problem-Solving tasks

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** In defined exercises (e.g. calculating rates, deriving a formula, optimising a protocol), the focus is on applying knowledge and demonstrating mastery of methods. The gold standard is to show your reasoning clearly, follow the solution path independently, and verify your answer. Support is available through worked examples, tutorials, and feedback from staff or peers.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI for hints, worked examples, or to identify logical errors in your reasoning, but ensure you complete all problem-solving steps yourself. You might ask GenAI to explain why a method works or to suggest alternative approaches, then apply and check these independently. Good practice means using GenAI as a tutor to clarify concepts while taking responsibility for the solution. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to provide answers or complete calculations on your behalf prevents you from developing the problem-solving skills being assessed,  and therefore constitutes misconduct. Poor practice includes copying solutions without understanding, skipping the reasoning steps, or failing to check accuracy. Over-reliance undermines your ability to justify and apply solutions in future contexts.

**Example Assessments:** Scenario-based quiz or viva, Scientific challenge write-up, Structured troubleshooting workflow design

## Self‑Assessment and Practice Questions

**Gold standard for Professional Practice:** Testing your knowledge and understanding by creating and practising questions similar to those that may appear in examinations or tests. This may involve designing short-answer or essay-style questions, producing answer keys, or making definitions of key terms for flashcards. The gold standard is to actively design and attempt these yourself to reveal gaps in understanding, strengthen recall, and practise applying knowledge. Support is available through revision resources, peer study groups, and staff feedback.

**How GenAI can be helpful (good practice):** Use GenAI to generate practice questions, flashcards, or typical problems after you have first attempted to think of some yourself. Compare GenAI’s suggestions with your own to identify overlooked areas or alternative question styles. You can also use GenAI to test your recall by generating variations on your questions, but you must write and check the answers yourself. Good practice means using GenAI as a supplement to broaden revision, not as a substitute for self-testing. 

**How GenAI can pose risks (poor practice):** Using GenAI to produce and answer all your practice questions for you prevents you from learning effectively and risks building poor habits, such as defaulting to GenAI even for simple tasks you could do yourself. Relying on GenAI instead of forming study groups or engaging with peers removes valuable opportunities for collaboration and feedback, which may also lead to isolation. Submitting or depending on unvetted GenAI-generated materials without oversight risks inaccuracies and misconduct. Overuse also ignores the environmental cost of unnecessary GenAI use.
